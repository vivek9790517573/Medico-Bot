The Disadvantages of Home Remedies

1.Poisonous Plants:

	Aside from natural food substances such as ginger, garlic, basil leaves, and so on, there are 
	numerous other herbs, including wild herbs, that are used as home remedies for diseases. However, 
	there are many poisonous wild herbs available, and if you do not know how to properly identify the 
	right herbs or parts of herbs, you will be in serious trouble.

2.Overdose Risk:

	Because these natural remedies are frequently available without a doctor's prescription, there is 
	a risk of overdosing on these substances, which can result in allergies, rashes, and other health problems.

3.Results Take Time to Appear:

	The-counter medications are well known for their immediate effect on the disease, whereas natural remedies 
	will take time to show results. It is because the healing process is often slow when compared to the counter 
	medicines.

4.Difficulty Determining the Exact Cause of a Disease:

	If you have a sore throat, you should be aware that it is a common disease as well as a common symptom 
	for many serious illnesses such as dengue, Covid 19, and so on.

	So, unless and until you consult with a professional physician and perform a sufficient number of lab tests,
	you will never know the precise cause of the illness.

5.Not as Effective in Treating Serious Illnesses:

	Without a doubt, home remedies or natural remedies frequently provide better relief in many common diseases. 
	Their effectiveness in treating accidents, emergencies, and other serious illnesses is still being questioned.

	There is a lack of proper evidence on home remedies to cure a broken bone or a heart attack, while the counter 
	medications are more effective in such cases.
